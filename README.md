## Hi there! üëã üìà
I'm **@torres-federico-e** currently Ssr. Data engineer with a passion for all things data. I 've had prior experience with Data Science and machine learning, predictive modeling, and geo data processing. However, now I've switched to the data preparation, data and system architecture needed to scale businesses and prepare them in the world of data and analytics. I've worked with data projects from every angle possible building solutions for companies and products; from simple SQL analytics, to Pipeline alignment and consolidations, to Tuning Machine Learning Churn models. Today I keep deep diving into what I feel is my niche, Data Engineering and Backend. I enjoy attention to detail, good work, and clean and clever visualizations. 

## What I Do ‚úèÔ∏è
As a Data engineer I have the most experience in designing scalable data pipelines that enable efficient and reliable data processing, both for normal volumes and using Big Data technologies. I have worked with Telecommunications industry and . I have experience working with some important data technologies including **Python, PySpark, Hive SQL, and Hadoop**. I've been also working with AWS Cloud lately.

## Projects üìù
Currently diving into personal development projects, some open source collaborations to contribute to the community and hone my skills.

## Stack & Skills  üìä
Here are some of the skills I've applied over my career and brought to the table:

- ETL's and Scalable data processing with Hadoop and PySpark ecosystem
- SQL based pipeline transformations with Hadoop Hive SQL for internal processing
- Geographic analytics data processing with Gis Systems over Hadoop 
- Data visualization _with Python for Engineering/DataScience_; Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- Data visualization _with Bussiness Intelligence layer_; Power-Bi, Tableau, Microstrategy.
- Automated Testing based on historical data statistics and deviations
- Statistical analysis 
- Machine learning modeling and assesment
- Cloud platform knowledge: AWS
